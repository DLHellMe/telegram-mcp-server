Startup funding hack I wish I knew earlier:

Instead of chasing VCs, I built in public and attracted investors to me.

Results:
- 3 term sheets in 6 months
- Better valuations
- Investors who actually understand the vision

Build loud, friends. The right people will notice.

Books that actually moved the needle for me:

1. "The Mom Test" - How to talk to customers
2. "Traction" - Finding your growth channel
3. "Zero to One" - Thinking differently about competition
4. "The Lean Startup" - But only chapters 3-7

What's your top founder book recommendation?
